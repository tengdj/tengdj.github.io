I am an Assistant Professor working with the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) at [Stony Brook University, SUNY](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), where I worked in the [Data Management and Biomedical Data Analytics Lab(BMIDB)](http://bmidb.cs.stonybrook.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Fusheng Wang](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~fuswang/). I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/home/) and my B.E. in Software Engineering from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://se.xjtu.edu.cn/). A full version of my CV can be found [here](/files/cv.pdf).

My research interests lie in Big Data, Spatial Data Management Systems, Spatial Approximate Query Processing, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). **I am looking for self-motivated Master's students. If you are interested in playing with big spatial data at a billion, even trillion scales, please drop me an email with your resume attached.**
